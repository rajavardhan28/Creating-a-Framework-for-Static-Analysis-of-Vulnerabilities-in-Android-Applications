# Static Android Vulnerability Analysis Framework

A modular and extensible framework for performing **static analysis** of Android applications (APKs) to detect **security vulnerabilities** such as insecure API usage, misconfigured permissions, data leaks, and more.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This framework is designed to:
- Detect vulnerabilities *without executing* Android applications.
- Use **control-flow**, **data-flow**, and **taint analysis** for precision.
- Support **machine learning** and **heuristic-based** enhancements.
- Integrate into **CI/CD pipelines** to automate security testing.

## 🏗 Architecture

APK Input → Preprocessing → Static Analysis Engine → Report Generation → Developer Feedback

Key components:
- Preprocessing using tools like `JADX`, `Apktool`, and `Dex2Jar`
- Analysis Engine: Combines rule-based, ML-based, and heuristic detectors
- Reporting Module: Outputs PDF and JSON vulnerability reports
- CI/CD & IDE Integration: Hooks for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Android Studio

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Taint analysis to track sensitive data flow
- ✅ Control-flow and ICC (Inter-Component Communication) analysis
- ✅ Deobfuscation and bytecode normalization
- ✅ Low false-positive rate via ML enhancement
- ✅ Plugin-based rule system for easy extension
- ✅ RESTful API and CLI for DevOps automation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Additional dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/android-static-analyzer.git
cd android-static-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`, upload an APK file for analysis, and download the report in JSON or PDF format.

## 📊 Results Summary

- Tested on 15 Android applications (50K–200K LoC)
- Detected an average of 18 critical vulnerabilities per app
- False positives under 12%
- Full analysis: ~8 mins per app on a 16-core CI system

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- Aligns with OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
- Detects misconfigured permissions, insecure API usage, and data leakage
- Integration with CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Compliance-ready reports in JSON/PDF format

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Lightweight dynamic tracing for obfuscated apps
- Third-party library analysis and dependency scanning
- Community-contributed rule marketplace
